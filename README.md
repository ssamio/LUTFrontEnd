## Student: Sami Seppälä
<p>To run this project on your own machine locally, open a terminal and navigate to the project root folder (assuming you have the downloaded it). From there, run 
          
    npm run sass
this enables you to make changes to the scss files.
If you do not have SASS installed on your machine, install it by running

    npm install -g sass

If you do not have Npm and Node installed, [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) will help you along.
</p>

<p>
  Open another terminal, and navigate again to the project root folder

      npm install

  ensures you have everything installed that the project needs to run.

  When it is done, navigate to the /dist folder, and run

      live-server
  That's it! You should have the project now running in your browser.
</p>

<p>
  Finally to publish the project (to your own Github Page), edit the "homescreen" field in package.json so it has your username in in my name's place, and the link contains your repo's name. Run 

    npm run deploy

to publish the page. Happy coding!
